MBABANEâ€Ž, eSwatini, January 22, 2023/APO Group/ --
                                                        
                            Government would like to express her condolences to the family, friends, relatives, and colleagues of lawyer Thulani Maseko, who was brutally shot and killed by unknown criminals at his home last night.



Lawyer Thulani Maseko's demise is a loss to the Nation and his footprints as a human rights lawyer are there as proof of his contribution to the country. He will surely be missed.
                                Government once again takes this opportunity to condemn the ruthless killing of civilians
                            

Our security forces have assured Government that they are already at work looking for the killers and they will not rest until they are brought to book, the same way some of these gun-toting individuals have been rounded up in recent weeks. We urge the Nation to alert the police if they have any information that may help in the apprehension of these criminals.

Government once again takes this opportunity to condemn the ruthless killing of civilians. This will include the recent murder of an Army officer at Bulembu camp, and all other previous killings of innocent civilians in the recent past.

Government also warns against speculations and insinuations peddled particularly on social media platforms in instances like these. Again, Government distinctly disassociates herself and the country's authorities from these heinous acts. Such speculations are dangerous as they hamper investigations and take the attention away from the real criminals.

In conclusion, Government urges the entire Eswatini Nation to be with the Maseko family in prayer during this sad period.
