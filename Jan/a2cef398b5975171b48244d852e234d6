                            Philippine Ambassador Leslie J. Baja met with Professor Mohammed El Ferrane, Director of Bibliothèque Nationale du Royaume du Maroc (BNRM, National Library of the Kingdom of Morocco) on 17 January 2023 to discuss possible cooperation in the fields of education, culture, and arts.



Ambassador Baja and Professor El Ferrane agreed that among the activities that may be co-organized by the Embassy and BNRM include expositions, lectures on Philippine history for Moroccan students and academics, cultural shows featuring traditional Filipino music and dance, and exchange of publications. The Ambassador expressed the hope that these activities will bridge the knowledge gap and increase the familiarity of Moroccans about the Philippines, its history, culture, literature, and art leading towards the commemoration of the 50th anniversary of Philippine-Moroccan diplomatic relations in April 2025.  

During the meeting, Ambassador Baja handed over Victory and Humanity: The 2021 Quincentennial Commemorations in the Philippines coffee table book to Professor El Ferrane noting that this publication is a good reference material on Philippine history and heritage.
