The Spokesman for the Presidency said the meeting followed-up on efforts to localize the fishing vessel industry in Egypt.

President El-Sisi was briefed on progress in efforts to localize the modern fishing vessels industry. The President gave directives to simultaneously integrate the construction process of these boats with the state's efforts to upgrade natural lakes nationwide and with initiatives to support fishermen. This shall double the fish production of these lakes, and hence support the economic conditions of fishermen, boost food security and the national economy, implement the state’s firm strategy of sound management, and leverage Egypt’s natural resources.

The meeting also discussed joint efforts with the private sector to localize the construction of modern yachts, and their maintenance, repair and construction centers, given Egypt’s potential in the field of marine tourism in the Mediterranean, the Red Sea and the Suez Canal Corridor, and capitalizing on Egypt’s unique geographic location and its modern ports along the republic’s coasts. This shall double the added value of the state in this field.
