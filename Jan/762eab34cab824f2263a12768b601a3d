The meetings will focus on bilateral relations between Finland and Senegal as well as topical international questions. Finland opened an embassy in Dakar in 2022. It is Finland’s first embassy in the French-speaking West Africa.

“It is important that Finland has closer relations with West Africa. We are affected by developments in the region, which also offers many opportunities for cooperation. Senegal is an important partner for Finland and for the EU in western Africa,” says Minister for Foreign Affairs Haavisto.

In Dakar, Foreign Minister Haavisto will meet members of Senegal’s National Assembly and representatives of research institutes, international organisations and civil society organisations. They will discuss the situation in Senegal and more widely in West Africa and the Sahel region.

During his visit, Foreign Minister Haavisto will inaugurate Finland’s Embassy in Dakar.
