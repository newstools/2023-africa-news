The Commission notes positively the reference to international obligations and African standards of transitional justice. In fulfilling its mandate from the UN Human Rights Council, the Commission welcomes the opportunity to discuss with the Government the various components of transitional justice to provide advice on the options presented for consultation; in particular, to strengthen inclusive, gender-responsive, victim and survivor-centered approaches to accountability, truth-telling and reconciliation, reparations, and the necessary policies for non-recurrence of violations.
