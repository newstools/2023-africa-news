The development follows a directive issued by health Cabinet Secretary Susan Nakhumicha a fortnight ago following constructive dialogue with leadership of the Kenya Medical Practitioners and Dentists Union (KMPDU) and the Council of Governors(COG).

During the meeting with KMPDU officials and COG committees on health and labour, which was held at the beginning of this year, various pending issues that cut across both levels of government were discussed and the road map towards their resolutions escalated.

According to the health CS, 874 medical interns will be posted during the ongoing exercise adding that the government remains committed to amicably resolve issues raised by the KMPDU even as she implored on them to embrace dialogue.

The Kenya Medical Practitioners, Pharmacists and Dentists Union had last year threatened to lead its members in downing tools from January 6, 2023 accusing the government of failing to honour its part of the bargain.
