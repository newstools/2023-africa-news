CAIRO, Egypt, January 20, 2023/APO Group/ --
                                                        
                            Today, President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi inspected axes and roads projects in the Giza Governorate, mainly the Lieutenant General Kamal Amer Axis, which is considered a new lifeline in the governorate. It is a transverse axis that passes through the governorate, south to  north, connecting Munib Ring Road to Warraq Ring Road. 



It is divided into four main sectors:

1. It starts from Munib Ring Road, passing through Tersa Bridge, Omraniya Bridge, Haram Street and Faisal Bridge, all the way to Saft Al-Laban with a length of 5 km, serving all traffic directions above Saft Al-Laban Bridge.

2. It has a length of 2 km and connects Saft El-Laban to Gamaet El-Dewal Al-Arabiya Street, passing through Sudan Street and Boulaq El-Dakrour metro station.

3. It starts from Gamaet El-Dewal Al-Arabiya Street to Warraq Ring Road with a distance of 5 km, passing through Sudan Street, 26th of July Axis and Al-Barageel Bridge.

4. It connects the Warraq Ring Road to Tahya Misr Axis, with a length of 3 km.

The President also inspected Ahmed Orabi Axis, which connects Al-Manshia Road to Ahmed Orabi Street, with a length of 11 km and a width of 6 traffic lanes in each direction. Ahmed Orabi Axis has been linked to the Ring Road and Kamal Amer Axis to be an alternative axis to ease traffic pressure on 26th of July Axis from the Ring Road to Lebanon Square and Sphinx Square in Mohandeseen.

The new axes in Giza aim to ease movement and reduce the time and distance within the governorate, in addition to linking it to nearby governorates, within the framework of the national plan for axes and roads across all governorates to accelerate and increase the rate of economic development, in line with the sustainable development  strategy in the country.
