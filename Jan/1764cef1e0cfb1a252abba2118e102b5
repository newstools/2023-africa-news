                            International partners* welcome efforts by Somalia’s leaders to advance priorities on peacebuilding and state-building, including through the regular meetings of the National Consultative Council. In particular, we welcome the renewed focus on the constitutional review process, federal resource-and power-sharing, and reconciliation, all of which are crucial to ensuring Somalia’s long-term stability. We call on all stakeholders to engage constructively in these efforts, and to resolve any differences through dialogue and consultation.
