MASERU, Lesotho, January 26, 2023/APO Group/ -- 
                                                        
                            Lesotho Competitiveness and Financial Inclusion Project in collaboration with Lesotho National Farmers’ Association (LENAFU) will equip farmers with skills to increase fruit production.



This is according to the Ministry of Trade, Industry, Business Development and Tourism Senior Public Relations Officer Ms. ‘Mantletse Maile. 

Ms Maile indicated that they intend to train farmers so they can have skills to meet the needs of Basotho by ensuring that they make fruits available to stop importing them and grow the economy of Lesotho. 
                                The apples are products of the World Bank programme aimed at strengthening the country’s private sector through high-value, high-potential value chains
                            

She further pointed out that funds will also be available to respond to the requirements of farmers and therefore increase fruit production in the country. She added that the event to be held in Hlotse this week is expected to attract farmers’ representatives. 

Ms Maile highlighted that during the training, they will have a tour at Mahobong Fruit Production Farms where farmers will learn more about the experiences of those who produce fruits. 

In early 2022, Lesotho Apple Growers had exported about 30 bins thus equivalent to 90,000 of Top Red and Golden Delicious apples to South Africa. 

The apples are products of the World Bank programme aimed at strengthening the country’s private sector through high-value, high-potential value chains such as nature-based tourism and horticulture with a focus on deciduous fruit production. 

The project first started in 2006 and locally it has sold to Shoprite, Game, and Pick n’ Pay stores. The government of Lesotho and the World Bank sponsor it.
