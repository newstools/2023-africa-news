The event also marked the return of Volunteers to Cameroon after nearly two and a half years of absence due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  Ambassador Lamora administered the oath of service to nine new Peace Corps Volunteers, stating that “Peace Corps embodies the best of America:  Service to others in the pursuit of peace and development.  The work you do is so very important and demonstrates the ongoing spirit of cooperation between the Cameroonian and American peoples.”  Since arriving in late October, the new volunteers have attended an intensive eleven-week cultural, language, and vocational training before being sworn in. Volunteers will work in health centers and with agricultural groups in the Center, Littoral, and South regions of Cameroon.
