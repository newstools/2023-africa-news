                            Once again, the Tanzania High Commission in Abuja, Nigeria, applauds the decision of Air Tanzania management to explore West Africa routes and for putting Nigeria in the fore of its plan. 



The meeting between Eng. Ladislaus Matindi, Managing Director and Chief Executive of Air Tanzania Company Limited (ATCL) and the H. E. Dr. Hamisu U. Takalmawa, High Commissioner of Nigeria to Tanzania  captured in the Air Tanzania Inflight Magazine, Issue 16, January-March, 2023, brings the reality of a direct flight between Tanzania and Nigeria closer than ever. The new route will open up and catalyze Tanzania-Nigeria trade and economic relations and thus take the bilateral ties to greater heights.
