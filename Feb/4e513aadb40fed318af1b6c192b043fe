The Conference addresses political developments in Palestine, in addition to the legal and development dimensions of investment, through three main axes.



The first axis highlights the political reality of the city of Al-Quds and the serious violations committed by the Israeli occupation government, such as land confiscation, settlement construction, house demolitions, forced displacement of citizens from their homes and attempts to change the legal and historical status of the Al-Aqsa Mosque, in addition to human rights crimes.



The second axis is related to the economic aspect and aims to identify development priorities and investment avenues in the Holy City, especially in the main priority sectors of housing, education, health, tourism, culture, women and youth.



As for the third axis, it includes the legal aspect, since the Al-Quds inhabitants are confronted with numerous racist Israeli laws and procedures, whose main objective is to repress them and which are considered part of the factors that expel the inhabitants of Al-Quds and deprive the Holy City of its Palestinian component.
