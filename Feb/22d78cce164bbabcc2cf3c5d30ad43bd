As the event is designed to promote Rwanda as a cycling destination for tourists, Team Europe riders not only took part in the race, but also experienced the stunning landscapes of Rwanda, from the rolling hills of the countryside to the bustling streets of Kigali and secondary cities. With their participation, Team Europe showcases the high potential of Rwanda not only to organise high-level sports events such as the Tour du Rwanda, but also become a prime destination for active tourists seeking new horizons for sports and adventure.

Team Europe’s participation in Ride Rwanda 2023 is also designed to demonstrate “Team Europe” spirit and priorities. EU and Member States are working with Rwanda as part of the Green Deal on climate-resilient agricultural transformation and green mobility.
