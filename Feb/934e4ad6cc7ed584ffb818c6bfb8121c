They had a productive meeting where they discussed the ongoing cholera outbreak in Northern Kenya and the measures being taken by the Ministry of Health to combat it, including the ongoing cholera vaccination drive.

They also addressed the ongoing severe drought in Mandera that has left many children malnourished. The Kenyan government and partners have come together to offer material aid, including food and health supplements, to those affected.

â€œAs the Ministry of Health, we are committed to partnering with counties such as Mandera in equipping health facilities to provide quality services to all citizens, including those in far-flung areas," the CS said.

The CS urged all Kenyans to take necessary precautions against cholera and seek medical attention if experiencing symptoms.
