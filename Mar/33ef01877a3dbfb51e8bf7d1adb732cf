                            The Presidency is in receipt of the Public Protector's preliminary report on the investigation of whether the President breached the executive ethics code with respect to the Phala Phala matter. We note the report.



As stated before, we reiterate that the President did not participate in any wrong doing, nor did he violate the oath of his office. Instead, the President was a victim of a crime that he duly reported to the relevant authorities.
