International collaboration and coordination between donors and regional countries is paramount to reversing forest and biodiversity loss and promoting sustainable development, and the UK is taking a leading role as Chair of the Central African Forest Initiative and co-chair of the Donor College within the Congo Basin Forest Partnership.

The UK will sign a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Government of Gabon, where both parties will agree to shared priorities in the context of the climate ambition and commitments made at COP26.

Further engagements will include high-level meetings with Heads of State, Government officials, as well as other public and political stakeholders on how to promote the emergence of tangible solutions for a transition to a low-carbon economy, for climate change adaptation and for the protection of biodiversity.

Minister Goldsmith said: I am delighted to be attending the One Forest Summit on behalf of the UK. This is a fantastic opportunity to work with our partners from across the globe to reaffirm the climate commitment made at COP26 to protect the Congo Basin forests and peatlands.
