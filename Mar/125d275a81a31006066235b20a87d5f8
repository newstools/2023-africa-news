ABYEI, South Sudan, March 1, 2023/APO Group/ --
                                                        
                            United Nations Interim Security Force for Abyei (UNISFA) condemns the movement of armed elements within the southern part of the Abyei Box on 28 February 2023. While the armed elements remain visible, the mission is deeply worried that this latest development within the southern part of Abyei will further exacerbate the conflict in the area and cause untold suffering and humanitarian concerns for the civilians in the area.


                                Abyei Box remains a weapon-free area that should not have the presence of any force either conventional or armed elements of both communities
                            

Abyei Box remains a weapon-free area that should not have the presence of any force either conventional or armed elements of both communities. It is therefore important that all parties respect the relevant Security Council Resolutions in this regard. In view of this, UNISFA condemns the renewed fighting within and around the borders of Abyei Box and urges all parties to cease fire and allow the political process to resolve the lingering crisis. UNISFA is against any form of unauthorized deployment within the Box.

UNISFA has strengthened the presence of peacekeepers in the Area and is closely monitoring the situation.

UNISFA echoes the Security Councilâ€™s request to both Sudan and South Sudan that the Abyei Area shall be demilitarized from any forces, as well as armed elements of the local communities, other than UNISFA and the Abyei Police Service. UNISFA will continue to do everything within its capacity to ensure that there is peace in the area and calls on all parties in the area to exercise restraint.
