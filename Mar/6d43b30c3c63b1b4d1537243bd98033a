                            World Health Organization Regional Office for Africa (WHO-AFRO) and United Nations Volunteers (UNV) programme partnered on Africa Women Health Champions (AWHC) initiative in March 2020 with 120 women health professionals in 38 countries across the African continent. Two years on, the AWHC initiative launched its second phase, this time with an even more expanded reach.
                                This solidifies WHO and UNV partnership further to improve health for people on the continent and expand opportunities for African health professionals
                            



Launched on International Women's Day 2023, AWHC phase two will span over the course of two years and recruit young women professionals between 22 and 35 years as UN Volunteer health champions across WHO Country Offices in Africa. 

This solidifies WHO and UNV partnership further to improve health for people on the continent and expand opportunities for African health professionals. It's also an example of women's leadership in the health sector in Africa while promoting gender parity in the WHO workforce.
